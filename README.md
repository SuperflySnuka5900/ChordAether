## Project Description

ChordAether is a tool designed for musicians and producers to generate chord progressions effortlessly.

The project is ideal for those looking to enhance their compositions or experiment with new musical concepts.

### How to run
1. Run setup.py, then make sure you are in the .venv environment.
2. If on Mac, run brew install fluid-synth. Otherwise see below. This step is optional, but you will not be able to play the sounds without it.
3. Run mid_GUI.py.

NOTE: The 'play' feature is only available if you have FluidSynth downloaded. The second step should do this for you, but it is not necessary.
For FluidSynth download help, visit https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/Download to download FluidSynth.

This program is not compatible with Linux devices.

#### How to use the program

The program should output a platform that allows users to generate chords with a click of a button. Adjust your desired chord progressions using the scale, chord length, upper extension, and key dropdowns. Tempo and instrument will alter playback.
The export midi button will prompt you to save a midi file of your chord progression.
